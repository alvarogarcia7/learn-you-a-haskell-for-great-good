Apparently, the function definition doubleMe does not work on the REPL

There is autocomplete on the REPL, hit TAB

Page 7: the apostrophe indicates a strict version of a function (i.e., one that is not lazy) or a slightly modified function or a variable with a similar name. [Could it also be used for the first derivative?]

Page 7: definition / name: when a function does not take any parameter

@: how to save the commands in the repl to a file?

Page 8: after using let, this variable is not found on the repl (?)

Examples:

Page 8:

*Main> 'a ':" small"
<interactive>:54:5: parse error on input `:'

; fails because 'a ' is not a character. the error is not very descriptive, though

*Main> "a"++" small"
"a small"
